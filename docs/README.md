# SeuratWrappers Vignettes

This directory contains individual method vignettes for each method provided by SeuratWrappers. Generally speaking, each vignette will have three files. Each file has the same content, just formatted and rendered differently:
 - `*.Rmd`: these are the source Rmarkdown files used to generate the other files. Viewing them will show only the raw code
 - `*.html`: these are knitted HTML files. Viewing them on GitHub will show only the raw HTML code. To view rendered HTML, checkout our [vignettes](https://satijalab.org/seurat/get_started.html) page or use the wonderful [GitHub HTML Preview service](https://htmlpreview.github.io/)
 - `*.md`: these are knited Markdown files. Viewing htem will show the rendered Markdownc content. We recommend looking at these files when browsing this directory on GitHub
