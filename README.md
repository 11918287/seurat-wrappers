# SeuratWrappers

SeuratWrappers is a collection of community-provided methods and extensions for [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/), curated by the Satija Lab at NYGC. These methods comprise functionality not presently found in Seurat, and are able to be updated much more frequently.

Please see our [contribution guide](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat.wrappers/wiki) for assistance and guidelines in developing and adding new methods to SeuratWrappers

Individual method vignettes can be found in the [`docs/`](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat.wrappers/tree/master/docs) directory, we recommend looking at the standard markdown (`*.md`) files when viewing on GitHub

Installation can be accomplished through [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools)

```R
devtools::install_github('satijalab/seurat.wrappers')
```
